# Simple-Sign-Up-In-by-JS
This code toggles between "Log In" and "Sign Up" views. When "Sign Up" is clicked, the title changes to "Sign Up" and the name input field is shown. Clicking "Log In" hides the name field and changes the title back. It uses JavaScript to control visibility and text dynamically, with social media links included below.
